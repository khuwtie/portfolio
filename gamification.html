        <h1 class="header primary-400">Gamification</h1>
        <p>Gamification is the addition of game mechanics into a nongame environment (typically educational) with a purpose of making an otherwise boring and tedious task more fun and enjoyable causing people to engage with the activity more and therefore grasp a greater understanding than they would have if they had for example just read a large chunk of text or listened to a lecturer talk about it for over an hour.</p>

            <p>Headspace primarily focuses on helping its users to meditate and to enhance the engagement, and to keep people meditating they implemented gamified elements, one being a reward system - more specifically after meditating for multiple days in a row the user gets a daily streak and is rewarded based on the amount of days the streak lasts. Features like rewards systems are extremely effective at making people feel as if it is now a part of their daily routine since it motivates them and gives them an incentive to do it even if the incentive isn't that big. Notifications prompting the users to keep up their daily meditations also influence them.</p>
            <p>Starbucks decided that for their app 'Starbucks' they would include a 'My Rewards' programme which aims to reward loyal customers and make customers feel they are getting more out of their purchases in the long run, giving a sense of empowerment. They achieve this by the use of their virtual currency called 'Stars' where the user is prompted to visit Starbucks (and make an order each time) an x amount of times from a starting date to an end date for bonus stars or the user is prompted to order something specific from the menu for bonus stars. Once enough stars are saved up, the customer can buy an item of their choice from the menu virtually for free.</p>

        <div class="container even-columns">
            <p>Gamification mostly shows positive outcomes. In a time where COVID-19 disrupted the flow of many people's daily lives, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648552/full#h4">gamified teaching strategies</a> can be seen as a reliable alternative to provide students with knowledge aswell as improve necessary collaboration skills during social distancing. This also allows students to find the motivation to work from home which can be difficult.</p>
            <p>The dominant aim of gamification is to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321630855X">foster human motivation.</a> Previous studies thought of gamification as something more narrow than it actually was, although there are a broad amount of game-like elements which would not properly show what gamification truly was or the benefits since some game design elements would be left out which would have its own benefits.</p>
