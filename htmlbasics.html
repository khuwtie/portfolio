    <h2 style="font-family: Arial">Summary:</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Arial" style="font-size:50px">Install the Amazon Go app and scan your QR code on the scanner, put your phone away and shop away as the app will handle everything for you whether you pick up an item; or put it back, your virtual basket is updated automatically. When you have picked up everything you want all you have to do is walk out of the store. Although this is very convienient for the customer, it is not for cashiers as this technology means that millions of cashiers are unnecessary and just an additional expense to the buisness. Because why would a business prefer to pay someone a salary for working instead of replacing them with AI that can do the same task without having to pay it.</font></p>
    <h2 style="font-family: Arial">Ethical & Moral Issues:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Puts millions of cashier worker's jobs at risk
        <li>Replacing human workers for AI just because an already wealthy business wants to save more money is morally wrong
        <li>Loss of jobs contributes to joblessness which contributes to homelessness so the number of people without jobs and homes many increase significantly
