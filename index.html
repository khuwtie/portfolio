        <br>
        <p>A man who wore a yellow hat, otherwise known as 'The Man with the Yellow Hat' man strolled through the jungle one day. Curious George loved yellow hat man because he looked like a banana. However, the man in the yellow hat did not feel the same. He hated monkeys especially George because he kept doing sus things.</p>
